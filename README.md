# Awesome Cookbook [![Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/examples/cookbook.pdf)
awesome-cookbook is a LaTeX template for a cookbook based on [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) (insired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv)) and the [xcookybooky](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xcookybooky) package. It is easy to use (even for people not familiar with LaTeX) and easy to customize. In case the provided options would not be sufficient one can always edit the template itself, which is fairly clean written and uses no dirty LaTeX hacks. The template is friendly on languages (eg. hebrew ect) and loads probably all packages you need.

This template is not provided as a package, the rule of thumb is:
> If [new] commands could be used with any document class, then make them a package; and if not, then make them a class.

this template is just another style for the book document class; thus not a package!

## <a name="examples"></a>Examples

There are several examples provided to get you up and running in no-time! For a more in depth explanation we refer to the [How to Use](#how-to-use) section.

* [cookbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/examples/cookbook.pdf) - **A showcase for all available options and features which you can use.** This gives you a nice impression on how a cookbook made with awesome-cookbook could look like. The `cookbook.tex` file is annotated to explain what each option does and can be seen as the documentation.
* [MWE auto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/examples/MWE_auto.pdf) - Uses the same data (recipes) as the cookbook example but without any options set before the `\begin{document}` environment. This `.tex` file is really minimal.
* [MWE manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/examples/MWE_manual.pdf) - Will look the same as `MWE auto` but does not use the autoGenerate functionally. Generally speaking you would want to use the autoGenerate feature because it makes your life easier.
* [MWE custom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/examples/MWE_manual.pdf) - This is for people that know LaTeX and want to customize the template, this does not use the "wrapper" commands so to speak. Your `.tex` file will look uglier and you must not forget to invoke a command but it gives you the most freedom this template has to offer. If you want to take it a step further you can edit the `awesome-cookbook.cls` file yourself. You would probably be particularly interested in the tikz cover page code, category title styling and recipe header styling. All are done in tikz. The `awesome-cookbook.cls` is fairly well annotated and should be rather easy to edit.

FYI; MWE stands for: Minimal Working Example

## <a name="how-to-use">How to Use
A full TeX ([LaTeX2e](http://www.latex-project.org/get/)) distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (most up-to-date) or use your distribution's package manager eg. `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`.  (It's generally a few years behind depending on your distribution, e.g Arch Linux is probably up-to-date, debian might not be)

If you use the `\autoGenerate` feature you must also install [LuaFileSytem](https://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/manual.html) or `lfs`. For Linux users this probably is available as a package in your package manager. Otherwise you can use LuaRocks: `luarocks install luafilesystem`.

This template supports:
- [x] [LuaTeX](http://luatex.org/)
- [ ] [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) (because of Lua script)
- [ ] [ConTeXt](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) (untested)
- [ ] [pdfTex](http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) (because of fonts and Lua script)

The template was only tested on Linux but other operating systems should work as well.

#### Make your own cookbook
To start from scratch:
* Download/clone this repository
* Copy the `autogenerate.lua,awesome-cookbook.cls,fontawesome.sty` files, folders `/fonts` and `/resources` to a new folder.
* Make a new `.tex` file (see the MWE [examples](#examples)) and off you go!

alternatively you may download/clone this repository and start playing with the examples.

To generate the pdf file. At a command prompt, run
```bash
$ lualatex --shell-escape {your-cookbook}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cookbook}.pdf`` (to make sure the tikzpictures are properly rendered you may have to invoke the command twice). Alternatively you may use an editor/IDE eg. [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/), [Texmake](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), [TeXworks](https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases), [Kile](http://kile.sourceforge.net/), [ _your favorite editor here_ ]. For a full list we refer to [tex.stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides).

**Remark:** do not forget the `--shell-escape` if you want to use `\autoGenerate` (you probably have to enable/add this to your editor/IDE's LaTeX command. See their documentation on how this can be done).

#### Using the template

awesome-cookbook is just a stylized version of the `book` class, specifically made for cookbooks. It provides some environments/commands to help you and styles some default elements to get a more modern cookbook look and feel. Recipes (`\recipe[<style>]{<name>}`) are under the hood just sections so you may use any LaTeX code underneath them. Because the aim is not to provide a full package, the customization options are not extensive (to keep the `.cls` file clean and slim). If you want to make significant changes to the style (eg cover page, recipe header, ...) we advice you to just edit the `.cls` file. All the "fancy" graphics are done with tikz.

A basic recipe looks something like this, note none of the environments/commands are mandatory:
```
\recipe{Tea}

\info[servings=1, time = 15]{}

\begin{ingredients}
  \ingredient{200}{ml}{water}
  \ingredient{1}{}{tea bag (your favorite flavor)}
\end{ingredients}

\begin{preparation}
    \step Put the water in a kettle, on a pit, and heat until the water almost boils.
    \step Pour the water into a cup and add the tea bag.
    \step Wait for about 10min and your tea is ready to drink!
\end{preparation}
```
for more information about the usage and all available options we refer to the [examples](#examples).

#### \autoGenerate

Big fuss over a <60 line Lua script (see [autogenerate.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/master/autogenerate.lua)) but anyway... this LaTeX command will automatically generate `\begin{document}` environment in your main `.tex` file. It will sort the recipes alphabetically for each category individually, in order for this to work you must provide the following files:
* Make a new folder (eg. `recipes/`) in the current directory of your `.tex` file and include:
  * Add a `categories.txt` file: each line represents a category. They will be included in the given order. eg.
```
Starters
Main Courses
Deserts
```
(if this file is not provided no categories, nor recipes, will be added)
  * For each category provide a folder with the identical name. All the `.tex` files inside will be included for that category, each file should probably represent 1 recipe. The recipes will be sorted on the their `.tex` file name **NOT** the`\recipe[<style>]{<name>}`. The name used within the recipe command may differ from your file name, eg. `tomato_soup.tex` and `\recipe{Tomato (Soup)}`.
For example:
```
./Starters/
      tomato_soup.tex
      chicken_soup.tex
      ...
./Main Courses/
      lasagna.tex
      pizza.tex
      ...
./Deserts/
      pudding.tex
      ...
```
  * Add a `preface.tex` file: this will load the provided `.tex` file between the TOC and the recipes. By default this file should only provide the `\begin{preface}` environment but you may add more chapters if you so desire. If this file is not provided the recipes will start right behind the TOC.
  * A folder named `appendices`: all `.tex` files in this directory will be added as appendix after the recipes. If not provided, or empty, no appendices will be added.
* Final result:
```
your_cookbook.tex
recipes/
    categories.txt
    preface.tex
    appendices/
      energy_list.tex
    Starters/
      tomato_soup.tex
      chicken_soup.tex
      ...
    Main Courses/
      lasagna.tex
      pizza.tex
      ...
    Deserts/
      pudding.tex
      ...      
```

It is rather straight forward, the [examples](#examples) use the `./recipes/` folder for this purpose. If something is not clear we refer to the examples as a guideline.

**Why bother?** It makes your life easier because you do not have to edit your main `.tex` file ever, nor do you have to manually sort the recipes. It also allows people not familiar with LaTeX to easily add a new recipe by just making a new `my_recipe.tex` file and drop in in the right (category) folder. **Even granny could do that!** You could host your family cookbook on a cloud service (eg. dropbox, google drive, one drive, ...) so the whole family can contribute to the cookbook by adding reicpes!

As mentioned before you are **not required** to use this command and may just add each recipe manually if you so desire.

## <a name="contribute">Contribute

Have you fixed a bug, added a new feature, improved the code or compatibility or anything else do not hesitate to fork and **make a PR!**

I try to keep the `.cls` file rather small and clean (no dirty LaTeX hacks) so if you want to go ham on tikz and provide a whole new style (instead of just add another simple recipe header style) i suggest you to just fork the template. Otherwise the `.cls` file may become hard to read and adapt for other people.

Have you found a bug, or want a specific feature, and don't know how to fix/add it? Check if there is not already a similar issue opened and if not make a **new [issue](https://github.com/Nooby4Ever/awesome-cookbook/issues/new)!**
